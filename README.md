### COSC 360: Web Programing 
Team: **Adam Delfs ; Isabella Mendoza ; Jolo Sesbreno**\
Professor: **Ifeoma Adaji**

## Overview: 
This semester-long project is designed to help develop relevant skills for full stack development.  With this project, we will build an online application that will allow users to register, create and participate in different features of our site.

The project will use a mix of these tools: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, & Apache.

## Project Statement:
To build a web-based tool that allows users engage in activities permitted for registered users.  Registered users should be able to access specific portions/features of your site that are not accessible to unregistered users.

## Our Site:
Our website will allow registered users to engage in online discussions and unregistered users to view discussions similar to forums such as [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/). The goal is to produce a similar type service that allows users to register, post content and make comments on items.   Additionally, unregistered users will be able to search and view the content but will not be able to edit or comment on posts. Registered users will be able to leave comments and replies.
